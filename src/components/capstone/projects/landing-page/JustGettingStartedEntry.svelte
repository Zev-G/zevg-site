        For my UI framework I'm going with <a href="https://svelte.dev/">Svelte</a>. After doing some research I decided to go with Svelte for this project. This decision was made because this project is going to be pretty big, so I want to use a framework I enjoy using, and Svelte meets this requirement.

        For hosting I ended up going with Firebase hosting <strong>(later switched to vercel)</strong>. I chose to use firebase because I had some experience with it from much smaller previous projects.

        For now I'm not using any backend framework to manage multiple pages <strong>(later began using SvelteKit)</strong>.
